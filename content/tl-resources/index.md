In this section I share curated links which I found useful and may interest people who want to learn more about open and responsible behavioural science research practices, dissemination and impact and tools for writing and conducting behavioural science research.

# General resources

## Podcasts

- [Teaching in higher education](https://teachinginhighered.com/episodes/): This is a very pragmatic podcast which gives interesting, practical, and research-informed insights for innovative teaching and learning tips. I particularly like the open aim to "being more effective at facilitating learning.

## Teaching and Learning textbooks

- [Technology and the curriculum](https://techandcurriculum.pressbooks.com): This is both a useful  resource and an interesting pedagogical project since the chapters were initially developed by students for an assignment, peer-reviewed, and edited.

# Tools and technology

## Tools I've used in class and for supervision

- [Calendly](https://calendly.com): I've used this for several years now. You can sync it to Outlook so if someone books a meeting, it appears in your calendar but also if you book a meeting in Outlook it will no longer be available in Calendly.
- [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com): I've only tried this recently it can be a lot of fun, for all ages. I've also asked students to create their own multiple-choice questions to help them reflect.
- [Loom](https://www.loom.com/education): I've seen it in use (at my daughter's primary school during lockdown!) but I have yet to embed it in my classes.
- [Microsoft OneNote Notebook](https://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/education/products/onenote/default.aspx?culture=en-gb&country=GB): I've started to use this recently too but it's been really useful to create and distribute editable handouts which students can complete on their own or in groups and keep them organised. The only drawback is archiving is not straightforward as it does not handle exporting to pdf at all from the app, it's best to print by logging into OneNote from the web and print from the website.
