abstract = "We investigated the role of interactivity in problem solving using a river-crossing problem. We found greater facility to transfer their experience of completing the problem from a low to a high interactivity condition as well as evidence that latency per move was significantly faster in the high interactivity group. So-called problem isomorphs instantiated in different task ecologies draw upon different skills and abilities; a distributed cognition analysis may provide a fruitful perspective on learning and transfer."
