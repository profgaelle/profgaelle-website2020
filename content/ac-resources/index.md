In this section I share curated links which I found useful and may interest people who want to learn more about open and responsible behavioural science research practices, dissemination and impact and tools for writing and conducting behavioural science research.

## Resources for responsible research and open science

- [SIPS](https://improvingpsych.org/): a learned society which brings together scholars working to improve methods and practices in psychological science. All the resources from the last SIPS conference are available on the OSF website [here](https://osf.io/vxq9d/). I recommend watching the videocast by Balazs Aczel, available [here](https://osf.io/2aryd/), starts at 18m30s.
- [RRBM](https://www.rrbm.network/): a virtual organisation dedicated to inspiring, encouraging, and supporting credible and useful research in the business and management disciplines. I encouraged anyone to read (and reflect on!) the [principles of responsible science](https://www.rrbm.network/position-paper/principles-of-responsible-science/). 
- [OSF](https://osf.io/): A free, open platform to support the management of research projects and enable collaboration. It is used by psychological scientists to share their materials and their data.
- [OSF Preprints](https://osf.io/preprints/): Free, open platform to share your working papers, with a doi via your Orcid account.  
- [ORCID](https://orcid.org): ORCID provides a persistent digital identifier (known as an ORCID iD) that you own and control, and that distinguishes you from every other researcher. I recommend watching [this video](https://vimeo.com/97150912) to understand the potential of having and curating an ORCID ID.
