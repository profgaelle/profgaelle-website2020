In my teaching and learning practice, I have become interested in the concept of microlearning (a.k.a. bite-size learning or micro lectures) and the idea of designing resources focusing on a single idea or topic and a short learning time (e.g., under 15 minutes) in a format that can be used and shared to learners at the right time in an easy to use format. 

This is a repository of resources I'm creating or curating in this context.
