I am a professor of behavioural science, director of research and enterprise for Kingston Business School, and principal investigator in the DART research lab. I am interested in the role played by social, physical and/or mental processes in cognition and knowledge work. My areas of research expertise include occupational vaccination decisions, the mediating role of interactivity in cognitive performance, as well the role of intuition and deliberation a.k.a. “fast and slow” thinking.
