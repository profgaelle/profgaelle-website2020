I am a professor of behavioural science and director of research and enterprise for [Kingston Business School](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/staff/profile/professor-gaeumllle-valleacutee-tourangeau-63/). After studying at Paris Ouest University (1998, MSc Social Psychology) and the University of Hertfordshire (2004, PhD), I began my career as a lecturer in Decision Sciences at Leeds University Business School (2001-2004). I then worked as a lecturer in Psychology in the School of Psychology at the University of Toulouse (2004-2009) before joining the Psychology Department at Kingston University in 2009. I joined Kingston Business School as a professor of behavioural science in January 2016.
