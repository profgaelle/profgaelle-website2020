This research programme focuses on the cognitive processes, heuristics, and biases which underpin judgements of risk and uncertainty, choices and decision-making. It includes studies and reviews of classic heuristics and biases such as the base-rate fallacy and the conjunction fallacy, the framing effect, the illusion of control, and the pseudodiagnostic bias.

It uses the experimental approach to study "what works" in the laboratory and in applied settings as well as a variety of behavioural and process-tracing measures (e.g., eye-tracking, reaction times, facial emotion recognition).
