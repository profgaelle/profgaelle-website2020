This research programme focuses on the cognitive processes, heuristics, and biases which underpin judgements of risk and uncertainty, choices and hypothesis-testing. It includes studies and reviews of classic heuristics and biases such as the base-rate fallacy and the conjunction fallacy, the framing effect, the illusion of control, and the pseudodiagnostic bias.
