Hello! Maria Marinovic, a PhD student affiliated with the BeSci lab and the Kingston School of Art is looking to know more about how your family sources toys. Especially, how likely you are to acquire second-hand toys for your children in the next 12 months. To take part, you should be a parent or guardian of children under the age of 11. You should also live in the UK (for at least a year) and be above the age of 18.  If you wish to take part, please follow the link below to an online questionnaire. Completing it takes approximately 10 minutes.  https://kingston.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1AkJa4g6KLyMASy The questionnaire will be open until the 1st of August 2022.   If you have any questions, please get in touch with Maria Marinovic at [m.marinovic@kingston.ac.uk](mailto:m.marinovic@kingston.ac.uk). Many thanks for taking part!
