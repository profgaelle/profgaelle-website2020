Are you onboard with AcWriMo yet? I hear you, who has time, especially these days? I tell myself I have 24 hours in a day! Of course, for some of us, a lot of these hours are already committed (school rounds, zoom meetings, anyone?). But the point is, if you really want to write, forget about finding the time to sit down, in the perfect state of mind and focus, without distractions... It will slip away before you know. You have to make time for it! Make an appointment with yourself in your calendar. Treat it with the same respect you'd treat an appointment with a dear friend or with your dentist (whatever works for you). Be realistic: don’t book a 4 hours if you can’t afford it. Start small, one hour if you can. Then when the time comes, leave the world on standby for the time being... And be gentle with yourself: it does not matter what you achieve in that time, success begins with making time to achieve your goals (more on this tomorrow!).
