Who will you tell? Another [behavioural science](/category/behavioural-science/) tip to stick to your [AcWriMo2020](/tag/acwrimo2020/) commitment is to make it public, make yourself **accountable**. Tell your friend, your grandma, your colleagues, sign-up online, write down your weekly goal in the comments below! If you only make a personal commitment, you run the risk that your future self will whisper excuses to do something else. You want to rely on a good friend. If you feel social support won’t be enough, a last resort could be to give money to a friend and tell them they can keep it if you don’t meet your goal (although you’ll have to trust them not to try to stir you away from your mission to get their reward!!!).
