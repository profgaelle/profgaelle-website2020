Some seems to think Covid19 is a blessing in disguise for academics who can now enjoy more "deep focus" time... Well, I haven't seen that happening! In fact, I seem to have less, not more, time for deep focus work than ever. So to counteract the disparaging blogs where other academics seek to inspire by showcasing about their astounding productivity, I thought I'd share my thoughts here for te rest of us who may be struggling to find time to get pen to paper... or fingers to keyboard.

November has been chosen as the month where strangers get together and write a novel under the [NaNoWriMo initiative](https://nanowrimo.org) a.k.a the National Novel Writing Month. A spin-off of this initiative, called AcWriMo was set up in 2011 by blogger Charlotte Frost and run until 2016 through the [PhD2Published blogging website](http://www.phd2published.com/). Since 2017, the event is no longer actively managed, but the idea has survived, along with twitter hashtag [#AcWriMo2020](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AcWriMo2020).

Writing is exercising for the brain. Like exercise, it’s hard to get started but behavioural science can help here too. The first step in any exercise routine is to start with a small concrete goal. It’s got to be both: small and concrete. Small because if you are too ambitious you could set yourself to fail (and we don’t want that!). If you are micro-ambitious, you increase your chances of reaching your goal, which will make you happy (and we want that, it’ll trick your brain to want to do it again!). You need a concrete goal too so there’s no ambiguity about whether or not you reached it. “*I will sit down and write everyday*” is probably too vague: it doesn’t specify what you will write about, and how much or how long you will write for. “*I will write 250 words in the introduction of Chapter 3*” is much better. It’s micro-ambitious, it’s specific, and it’s quantified. It will be easy to check whether you did or didn’t meet your goal. It’s up to you whether you make it a daily goal or a weekly goal (or both). But the more concrete you make it the greater the chances of success. So pick a time and day too! My own micro-ambitious goal will be to spend an hour everyday on revising a manuscript and sending it back to my co-authors by the end of the week. What will yours be?
