Some seems to think Covid19 is a blessing in disguise for academics who can now enjoy more "deep focus" time... Well, I haven't seen that happening! In fact, I seem to have less, not more, time for deep focus work than I ever had. So the reminder that November is the AcWriMo a.k.a. Academic Writing Month was a good prompt to keep me back on track.
