On 19th April 2021, Karis was informed that the paper from her doctoral work entitled *The moderating effect of autonomy on promotional health messages encouraging healthcare professionalsâ€™ to get the influenza vaccine* had won the 2020 Raymond S. Nickerson Award for the best paper in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied.

Ray Nickerson was the inaugural editor of JEP:A and a best paper is chosen each year by the JEP:A editorial team in conjunction with Division 21 of the American Psychological Association in his honor.

As the recipient of this award, Karis is invited to deliver an oral presentation as part of the Division 21 program at the 2022 APA Convention (Minneapolis; August 4-7).  The organisers will reserve a special session for the winner of this award and include a short ceremony to present the award.

Well done Karis! :tada: :clap: :star:
